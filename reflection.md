Which methods did you decide to overload, and why?
**House**
* I overloaded the constructor in House.java so that default houses with no elevator and no dining room could be 
    created without needing to pass in any information.
* I overloaded the moveIn() method so that it takes an integer, and the method adds "Student 1, Student 2, ... , Student n" to the House. This would be useful for adding a specific number of unnamed students to a House to reserve spots.

**Library**
* 
**Cafe**
*
